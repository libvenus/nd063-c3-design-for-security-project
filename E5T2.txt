# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- regula  is a tool that evaluates infrastructure as code files for potential AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes security and compliance violations prior to deployment.
- jforg xray can also be used

### Example vulnerability
S3 bucket server side encryption should be enabled [High]
S3 buckets should have all `block public access` options enabled [High]
S3 bucket policies should only allow requests that use HTTPS [Medium]

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- jforg xray

### Example vulnerability
Apache Commons IO FileNameUtils.normalize Path Traversal Remote File Disclosure Weakness

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
AWS Config

### Example vulnerability
Checks if Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) subnets are assigned a public IP address. This rule is NON_COMPLIANT if Amazon VPC has subnets that are assigned a public IP address.
