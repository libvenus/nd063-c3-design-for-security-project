# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1. WAF 
2. Role with token expiration of 1 hour

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The hardening that we did will be lost along with all the remediation steps
