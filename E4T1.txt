# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
How was the hacker able to infiltrate into the system:
1. Block SSH/SCP from any public ip to the bastin host and application instance . People who need access to bastin host should use systems manager. Even better will be to make immutable deployment 
2. The intended traffic for the web service instance is http on port 5000 so we will allow only that using SGs
3. Use roles instead of API keys so that the blast radius is limited along with the time (token expiration)

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
The instance role is too permissive - it allows any operation on any resource we have to apply the principal of least privileges and allow only list and get on free receipe bucket
